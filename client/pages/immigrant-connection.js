        Will your services only help people who are here "illegally?" Our heart
        is to help immigrants follow the law. We will comply with governmental
        regulations to help immigrants who have been here “undocumented” correct
        their status while also helping those who came with documents remain “in
        status.” What immigration paperwork can you help me with? Our office can
        work on cases including: advice and counsel, naturalization, family
        petitions, adjustment of status, renewal of legal permanent residency,
        DACA renewals, U Visas, VAWA (Violence Against Women Act), fiancé visas,
        religious worker petitions, and consular processing. For a list of more
        services, visit our webpage "Services" under the Immigrant Connection
        PDX tab. What do your legal services cost? Fees vary depending on the
        case. We follow a fee schedule from the national Immigrant Connection
        network where our office begins at $40.
