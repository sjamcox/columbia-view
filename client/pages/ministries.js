        Our ministries can be summed up in three words: belong, believe, and
        become. First, our ministries provide both places and spaces where you
        can belong just as you are. We are a diverse and eclectic group of
        people all seeking to know God’s heart. Second, our ministries are
        designed to help you move towards greater alignment with the Bible. We
        believe the story of the Bible ultimately points to Jesus, and through
        belief in Jesus, we can truly know God’s heart. Lastly, we view our
        ministries as tools God can use to shape you to become the person he
        intends you to be; reflecting the life and character of Jesus as you
        seek to share his heart with your people.

        Worship Service Every Sunday, we gather and worship through music,
        prayer, preaching/teaching of God's word, giving, and testimony. Worship
        for us is the response of a life that is seeing after Jesus. If you are
        a guest with us, we encourage you to come with an open heart to what God
        may want to do in your life, and don't worry, we will not embarrass or
        call on you during worship. Worship Service: 10:00 am ​ ​ ​ ​ We also
        live stream our worship services via Facebook each Sunday at 10:00 am.

        Youth Ministry We offer periodic outings and yearly retreats, camps, and
        service opportunities. Rather than a traditional "youth group," we seek
        to integrate youth into the overall life of our church through our
        worship services and life groups.
