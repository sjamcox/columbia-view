          Columbia View Wesleyan Church is a church body committed to
          consistently pursuing a personal knowledge of the heart of God and
          then sharing that with our people. The Wesleyan church has had a
          presence in Portland since 1893. We are honored to carry on a rich
          commitment to study, know and teach the Word of God in this great
          city.

          What can I expect on a Sunday morning? After parking in our parking
          lot, you will walk through the main entrance double doors. You will be
          greeted by a few smiling faces, handed our updated bulletin (info on
          the service and upcoming events) and offered complementary coffee and
          baked goods. Sunday morning worship service begins at 10:00 am. Our
          people are very laid back and friendly. What do you provide for babies
          and/or children? We have a nursery on-site for families with infants
          and babies to utilize. We also offer a children’s Sunday School class
          during our Sunday worship from 10:00 - 11:00 am on Sunday mornings.
          All nursery and children volunteers are background checked and
          trained. What should I wear? Clothes. Just come in something that
          you’re comfortable with. Where can I park? In our parking lot that
          wraps around the church building including the front, the right side,
          and the rear of the church. What is the music style? We believe the
          worship music should reflect the congregation, and therefore we offer
          a blend of hymns and contemporary music. How big is the church? Our
          directory has around 70 names, and on a given Sunday we will have
          anywhere between 20-50 people.
